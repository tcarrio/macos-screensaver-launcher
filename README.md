# macos-screensaver-launcher

Ever wanted to run the macOS screensaver from the Spotlight? So did I.

Say `Hi` to the most basic Go script in the literal world.

## Building

```shell
./build.sh
```

Congrats, you have a binary in `./bin` ready to execute.

Spotlight should be smart enough to detect it exists.

## Running

1. Super+Space
2. Type "run-screensaver"
3. ??? (I don't know that's none of my business)
4. Profit
